I was a girl in the village doing alright
Then I became a princess overnight
Now I gotta figure out how to do it right
So much to learn and see
Up in the castle with my new family
In a school that's just for royalty
A whole enchanted world is waiting for me
I'm so excited to be (Sofia the First)
I'm finding out what being royal's all about (Sofia the First)
Making my way, it's an adventure every day (Sofia)
It's gonna be my time (Sofia)
To show them all that I'm Sofia the First


Moana, make way, make way
Moana, it's time you knew
The village of Motunui is all you need
The dancers are practicing
They dance to an ancient song

[ELDERS]
Who needs a new song? This old one's all we need

[CHIEF TUI, VILLAGERS, VILLAGERS & CHIEF TUI]
This tradition is our mission
And, Moana, there's so much to do (Make way)
Don't trip on the taro root, that's all you need
We share everything we make (We make)
We joke and we weave our baskets (Aha!)
The fishermen come back from the sea

[BABY MOANA]
I wanna see

[CHIEF TUI, CHIEF TUI & VILLAGERS]
Don't walk away
Moana, stay on the ground now
Our people will need a chief and there you are

There comes a day
When you're gonna look around
And realize happiness is where you are

[CHIEF TUI, VILLAGERS, CHIEF TUI & VILLAGERS]
Consider the coconut (The what?)
Consider its tree
We use each part of the coconut, that's all we need

[SINA & VILLAGERS]
We make our nets from the fibers (We make our nets from the fibers)
The water is sweet inside (The water is sweet inside)
We use the leaves to build fires (We use the leaves to build fires)
We cook up the meat inside (We cook up the meat inside)

[CHIEF TUI & VILLAGERS]
Consider the coconuts (Consider the coconuts)
The trunks and the leaves (Ha!)

[CHIEF TUI, SINA & VILLAGERS]
The island gives us what we need

[YOUNG MOANA]
And no one leaves
[CHIEF TUI, CHIEF TUI & VILLAGERS]
That's right, we stay
We're safe, and we're well-provided
And when we look to the future, there you are
You'll be okay
In time, you'll learn just as I did

[CHIEF TUI & SINA, CHIEF TUI, SINA & VILLAGERS]
You must find happiness right where you are

[GRAMMA TALA]
I like to dance with the water
The undertow and the waves
The water is mischievous, ha!
I like how it misbehaves
The village may think I'm crazy
Or say that I drift too far
But once you know what you like, well, there you are

You are your father's daughter, stubbornness and pride
Mind what he says, but remember you may hear a voice inside
And if the voice starts to whisper to follow the farthest star
Moana, that voice inside is who you are

[MEN, SINA & WOMEN]
We make our nets from the fibers (We weave our nets from the fibers)
The water is sweet inside (A real tasty treat inside)
We use the leaves to build fires (We sing these songs in our choirs)
To cook up the meat inside (We have mouths to feed inside)
[CHIEF TUI, MEN & WOMEN]
The village believes in us (Ha! That's right!)

[CHIEF TUI, SINA & WOMEN, MEN]
The village believes (Ha!)

[CHIEF TUI, SINA & VILLAGERS]
The island gives us what we need

[CHIEF TUI]
And no one leaves

[MOANA, MOANA & VILLAGERS]
So here I'll stay
My home, my people beside me
And when I think of tomorrow, there we are
I'll lead the way
I'll have my people to guide me

[MOANA & VILLAGERS]
We'll build our future together where we are
'Cause every path leads you back to where you are
You can find happiness right where you are, where you areWell, it's nice to see that humans never change


Open your eyes, let's begin
Yes, it's really me, it's Maui, breathe it in
I know it's a lot, the hair, the bod
When you're starin' at a demigod

What can I say except, "You're welcome"?
For the tides, the sun, the sky?
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy

Hey! What has two thumbs and pulled up the sky
When you were waddling yay-high? This guy!
When the nights got cold, who stole you fire from down below?
You're lookin' at him, yo!
Oh, also, I lassoed the sun

[MAUI, spoken]
You're welcome

[MAUI]
To stretch your days and bring you fun
Also, I harnessed the breeze

[MAUI, spoken]
You're welcome

[MAUI]
To fill your sails and shake your trees

So what can I say except, "You're welcome"?
For the islands I pulled from the sea?
There's no need to pray, it's okay, you're welcome (Ha!)
I guess it's just my way of being me

You're welcome, you're welcome
Well, come to think of it

Kid, honestly, I could go on and on
I could explain every natural phenomenon
The tide, the grass, the ground
Oh, that was Maui just messin' around
I killed an eel, I buried its guts
Sprouted a tree, now you got coconuts
What's the lesson? What is the takeaway?
Don't mess with Maui when he's on a breakaway
And the tapestry here on my skin
Is a map of the victories I win
Look where I've been, I make everything happen
Look at that mean Mini-Maui just tickety-tappin'
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hey
[MAUI & CHOIR]
Well, anyway, let me say you're welcome (You're welcome)
For the wonderful world you know (Ha, ha, ha)
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome (You're welcome)
Well, come to think of it, I gotta go (Ha, ha, ha)
Hey, it's your day to say, "You're welcome" (Hey, hey, hey, hey, you're welcome)
'Cause I'm gonna need that boat (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
I'm sailing away, away, you're welcome (Hey, hey, hey, hey, you're welcome)
'Cause Maui can do everything but float (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
(You're welcome) You're welcome
(You're welcome) You're welcome
And thank you!
